# Milo's personal website

This is my personal website. I like to spend ~~too much~~ just enough time discovering and playing with new web tech, which at the moment is mostly Svelte. Feel free to copy / fork / get inspiration from my humble code.

## What's inside?

Aside from a summary of myself, I like to play with the creation of web-apps. One I keep coming back to is Webneut, an interactive [neutrino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino) oscillation simulator. This is the fifth(?) iteration of this tool and probably not the last.

## Developing

Install the dependencies with `npm install`, `yarn install` or equivalent for your setup.

To start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
